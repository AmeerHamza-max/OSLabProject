Process Scheduler Simulator: Implement a simulator that demonstrates various process scheduling algorithms (e.g., FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority Scheduling). The simulator should allow users to input process information (arrival time, burst time, priority) and display scheduling results, including average waiting time and average turnaround time.
